# hello-world
my first repository file on github

Ilatyphi95 here, I am on the android developer track organized by Google, Andela learning community and Udacity.
One of the pre-requisite I need for successful completion of the course is learning how to use GitHub.
I look forward to you helping me in my new quest.
Till I need your assistance again,
Thank you.
