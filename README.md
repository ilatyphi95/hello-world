Ilatyphi95 here, I am on the android developer track organized by Google, Andela learning community and Udacity
One of the prerequisite I need for successful completion of the course is learning how to use GitHub.
I look forward to you helping me in my new quest.
Till I need you assistance again,
Thank you.
